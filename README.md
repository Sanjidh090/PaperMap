# PaperMap

PaperMap is a production-style interactive learning website for the paper **Attention Is All You Need** (Vaswani et al., 2017).
It turns dense research concepts into clear visual modules, with guided sections, dynamic demos, architecture maps, and comprehension quizzes.

## Live Entry Points

- `index.html`: Product landing page for PaperMap.
- `Attention_Is_All_You_Need.html`: Full interactive explainer (core application).

## Repository

- GitHub: https://github.com/AdilShamim8/PaperMap

## Highlights

- End-to-end narrative for Transformer fundamentals.
- Interactive modules for tokenization, embeddings, attention, architecture, and optimization.
- Accessible baseline with semantic structure, skip link, keyboard-friendly controls, and reduced-motion support.
- Static-site architecture with zero build step and simple deployment.

### Other Static Hosts

You can deploy this project as-is to Netlify, Vercel (static), Azure Static Web Apps, or any Nginx/Apache static host.

## Production Notes

- Keep file names stable to avoid broken links.
- Prefer self-hosting fonts if you need strict offline or CSP policies.
- For SEO previews, add a real Open Graph image URL for your domain.
- Run Lighthouse checks before each release.

## Content and Branding Customization

- Update branding text in `index.html` and the navigation area of `Attention_Is_All_You_Need.html`.
- Update metadata tags (`title`, `description`, and Open Graph fields) for your domain.
- Tune section copy and examples for your audience (students, engineers, interview prep, etc.).

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- All section links in the top navigation scroll correctly.
- Mobile layout is usable at widths between 360px and 430px.
- Interactive demos render and update without console errors.
- Quiz interactions and chart drawing functions execute correctly.
- Keyboard tab order remains clear and predictable.
