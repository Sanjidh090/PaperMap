PaperMap is an open-source, static-first library of interactive AI paper explainers.

The goal is simple: turn dense research papers into visually rich, beginner-friendly, and research-accurate learning experiences.

Current status: 5 live interactive paper explainers.

## Run Locally

Option 1:

Open index.html directly in your browser.

Option 2 (recommended):

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node.js
npx serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080

## Add a New Paper (Standard Workflow)

1. Create a new HTML file inside paper/.
2. Use an existing paper page as your style and structure template.
3. Keep naming clean and readable, for example BERT.html or Diffusion_Models.html.
4. Add your paper card and links in index.html.
5. Verify responsive behavior on desktop and mobile.
6. Include complete metadata in the head section.
